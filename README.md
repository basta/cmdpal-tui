CmdPal üöÄ

CmdPal (Command Palette / Command Pal) is a fast, keyboard-driven TUI (Terminal User Interface) application for efficiently managing and executing your frequently used shell commands and scripts.

Stop digging through history or notes! Define your tasks once ‚Äì with names, commands, working directories, and descriptions ‚Äì then find and run them instantly using an intuitive fuzzy search interface.

Built with Python and the modern Textual framework.

Features ‚ú®

    TUI Launcher: Interactive terminal interface for browsing, searching, and running tasks.

    Fuzzy Search: Quickly filter tasks by name or description as you type.

    Keyboard Driven: Designed for efficient keyboard navigation and execution (Up/Down, Enter, Esc).

    Task Definition: Define tasks with a name, the command string, a specific working directory (cwd), and an optional description.

    Persistence: Tasks are stored locally in a simple JSON file.

    Automatic ID Generation: Manually add tasks to the JSON without an id; CmdPal generates and persists one automatically.

    Recency Sorting: Displays tasks sorted by most recently run when the filter is empty.

    CLI Management: Add, list, edit, and delete tasks directly from the command line.

    Cross-Platform: Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (wherever Python and Textual are supported).

Installation üì¶

The recommended way to install CmdPal for global use is via pipx. This installs the application and its dependencies in an isolated environment while making the cmdpal command available system-wide.

    Install pipx (if you don't have it):

    # Using pip (ensure ~/.local/bin is on your PATH)
    python -m pip install --user pipx
    python -m pipx ensurepath

    # Or use your system package manager (e.g., apt, brew)
    # sudo apt install pipx
    # brew install pipx

    Install CmdPal:

        Clone this repository:

        git clone https://github.com/your_username/cmdpal-tui.git # Replace with actual URL
        cd cmdpal-tui

        Install using pipx:

        pipx install .

Now you should be able to run cmdpal from anywhere!
Usage üöÄ
Launching the TUI

Simply run the command in your terminal:

cmdpal

Using the TUI

    Filtering: Start typing in the input box to filter tasks by name/description using fuzzy search.

    Navigation: Use the Up and Down arrow keys to highlight tasks in the list.

    Preview: The pane at the bottom shows the full command and working directory for the highlighted task.

    Execution: Press Enter on the highlighted task to execute its command. The TUI will close, and confirmation/execution details will print to your terminal.

    Quitting: Press Escape or Ctrl+C to exit the TUI without running a command.

Using the CLI for Task Management

Manage your tasks directly without launching the TUI:

    List Tasks:

    cmdpal list

    (Displays ID, Name, CWD, and Description for all tasks)

    Add Task:

    cmdpal add --name "My Task Name" --cmd "echo 'Hello World'" --cwd "/path/to/run/in" --desc "A description"

    (Requires --name and --cmd. --cwd defaults to ~, --desc is optional)

    Edit Task:

    # Identify by unique ID (recommended if names might clash)
    cmdpal edit <TASK_ID> --name "New Name" --cmd "new command"

    # Or identify by unique Name
    cmdpal edit "My Task Name" --cwd "/new/path"

    (Specify only the arguments you want to change. Fails if the name matches multiple tasks.)

    Delete Task:

    # Identify by unique ID (recommended)
    cmdpal delete <TASK_ID>

    # Or identify by unique Name
    cmdpal delete "My Task Name"

    (Prompts for confirmation. Fails if the name matches multiple tasks.)

    Show Tasks File Path:

    cmdpal --tasks-path

    (Prints the full path to the tasks.json file and exits)

Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Tasks are stored in a JSON file located at:

    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmdpal/tasks.json (if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)

    ~/.config/cmdpal/tasks.json (default fallback)

You can manually edit this file (CmdPal will generate missing IDs on next run), but using the CLI commands is generally recommended.
Development Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Interested in contributing or modifying CmdPal?

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your_username/cmdpal-tui.git # Replace with actual URL
    cd cmdpal-tui

    Create virtual environment using uv:

    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate # Or equivalent for your shell

    Install in editable mode with dev dependencies:

    uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

    Now you can run cmdpal and your code changes will be reflected immediately. You can also run linters/tests (e.g., ruff check ., pytest).
